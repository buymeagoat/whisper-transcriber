# TODO: Copilot Evaluation
- [ ] A1 Jobs API rejects authenticated uploads
	- Details: `/jobs/` currently depends on `X-User-ID`; authenticated admin requests without that header fail with 401 and block uploads (`tests/test_api_flow.py`).
		- New: `docker compose up --build` fails because the worker image installs Python 3.14, but `numba` (pulled in by `openai-whisper`) only supports <3.14; wheel build aborts before tests run.
	- Fix:
		- Update `api/routes/dependencies.get_authenticated_user_id` to derive the caller from the JWT/cookie session (fall back to header for legacy) and validate against the database.
		- Downgrade the Docker builder/runtime base images to Python 3.13-slim so `openai-whisper`/`numba` can install.
	- Model: `pytest tests/test_api_flow.py`; docker smoke cycle (upload tiny WAV).
	- Next Action: Point all Python stages in `Dockerfile` to `python:3.13-slim-bookworm`, rebuild, then re-run the smoke workflow.
