#### API Simplification
- **6 core endpoints** instead of 15+ complex endpoints:
  - `GET /` - Health check and service info
  - `POST /transcribe` - Upload and start transcription
  - `GET /jobs/{id}` - Get job status and transcript
  - `GET /jobs/{id}/download` - Download transcript
  - `GET /jobs` - List all jobs
  - `DELETE /jobs/{id}` - Delete job and files
  - `WebSocket /ws/jobs/{id}` - Real-time progress updates

#### Performance Improvements
- **Faster startup time** due to SQLite vs PostgreSQL
- **Reduced memory footprint** with streamlined dependencies
- **Improved transcription speed** with optimized worker configuration
- **Better error recovery** with robust job retry mechanisms

## [1.x.x] - Legacy Versions

Previous versions (1.x.x) used a different architecture with PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ. Those versions are no longer maintained. See [internal archives](docs/internal/archive/) for historical information.

### Migration from 1.x.x

Version 2.0.0 is a complete rewrite and is not compatible with 1.x.x installations. Fresh installation is required.
