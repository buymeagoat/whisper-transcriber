# Document Consolidation Notice

## Summary
Multiple project management documents have been consolidated into a single source of truth to eliminate confusion and document creep.

## Consolidation Actions (2025-10-22)

### **NEW SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**
- **ðŸ“‹ PROJECT_MASTER.md** - Complete project scope, architecture, and task management

### **ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS**
The following redundant documents have been moved to `archive/development-artifacts/`:
- `TASKS.md` - Task tracking (superseded by PROJECT_MASTER.md)
- `TASKS_MAINTENANCE_GUIDE.md` - Maintenance procedures (integrated)
- `PROJECT_READINESS_PLAN.md` - PM assessment (completed, archived)
- `CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md` - Architecture guidance (integrated)
- `SECURITY_ISOLATION_COMPLETE.md` - Security implementation (completed, archived)
- `DEPLOYMENT_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` - Security procedures (integrated)

### **RETAINED DOCUMENTS**
Core project documents that remain active:
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `PROJECT_MASTER.md` - **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all project management

## Going Forward

### **All Project Management References**
- Use **PROJECT_MASTER.md** for all task tracking, priorities, and project scope
- Archive completed work in PROJECT_MASTER.md rather than separate documents
- Update PROJECT_MASTER.md when task statuses change

### **No More Document Proliferation**
- Do not create additional task tracking documents
- Consolidate all project management information in PROJECT_MASTER.md
- Use existing docs/ structure for technical documentation only

### **Clear Separation**
- **PROJECT_MASTER.md**: Project management, tasks, priorities, roadmap
- **docs/**: Technical documentation, API references, guides
- **README.md**: Project overview, quick start, setup
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and release notes
