## 🗂️ **Quick Reference for GitHub Copilot**

### **🎯 Most Urgent Issues**
1. **Server Reliability** → T001 (Fix startup/shutdown in test environment)
2. **No User Authentication UI** → T002 (90% of backend features inaccessible)

```bash
# Start development server (currently unreliable)
docker-compose up -d  

# Run comprehensive validator 
python comprehensive_validator.py
