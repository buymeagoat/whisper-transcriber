# URGENT: Architecture Consolidation Required

## Project Manager Decision
**CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Dual FastAPI applications must be consolidated before continued development.

## Recommended Approach
1. **Target Architecture**: Single FastAPI application in api/ directory
2. **Migration Strategy**: Incremental feature migration with testing
3. **Timeline**: 1 week for consolidation, 1 week for validation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Manual Review Required**: Compare unique features in both applications
2. **Route Mapping**: Create comprehensive route comparison
3. **Feature Migration**: Move unique app/ features to api/
4. **Testing Validation**: Comprehensive test suite execution
5. **Import Updates**: Update all references throughout codebase

## Automation Ready
- Backup system: ✅ Implemented
- Test validation: ✅ Ready
- Analysis tools: ✅ Available
- Rollback plan: ✅ Prepared

## Status
