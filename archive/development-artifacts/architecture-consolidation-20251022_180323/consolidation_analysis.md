# Architecture Consolidation Analysis

## Current State
- **app/main.py**: Primary application (1400+ lines)
- **api/main.py**: Secondary application (391+ lines)

## Identified Issues
1. **Duplicate FastAPI Applications**: Two complete apps with overlapping functionality
2. **Route Conflicts**: Potential conflicts in endpoint definitions
3. **Middleware Duplication**: Security middleware in both applications
4. **Database Connections**: Multiple connection management systems
5. **Import Confusion**: Conflicting import paths

## Consolidation Strategy
1. **Primary Application**: Use api/main.py as foundation (cleaner structure)
2. **Feature Migration**: Move unique features from app/main.py to api/main.py
3. **Middleware Unification**: Consolidate to single security middleware
4. **Route Consolidation**: Merge all unique routes into single application
5. **Import Cleanup**: Update all references to use unified structure

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Medium Risk**: Import reference conflicts
- **Low Risk**: Performance impact

## Mitigation Plan
- Comprehensive testing before and after
- Incremental migration approach
- Backup and rollback procedures
- Route-by-route validation
