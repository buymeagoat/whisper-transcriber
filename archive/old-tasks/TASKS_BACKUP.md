## üéØ **Current Priorities**

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES (Immediate Action Required)**

### **T038: ARCHITECTURAL REDUNDANCY - DUPLICATE FASTAPI APPLICATIONS** üî¥
**Priority**: CRITICAL (Discovered in Multi-Perspective Evaluation)  
**Risk**: HIGH (Maintenance nightmare, deployment conflicts, developer confusion)  
**Impact**: Core system architecture integrity compromised  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks  

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The system has **TWO COMPLETE FASTAPI APPLICATIONS** with overlapping functionality:
- **`app/main.py`**: 925+ lines, complete FastAPI setup, authentication, job management, WebSocket support
- **`api/main.py`**: 391+ lines, duplicate FastAPI configuration, overlapping routes, similar middleware

**Issues Created**:
- Duplicate routes for health, authentication, job management
- Overlapping middleware configurations (CORS, security headers, rate limiting)
- Similar lifespan management and database initialization
- Redundant static file serving and SPA routing
- Two separate ORM bootstrap files creating potential race conditions
- Maintenance burden with dual codebases
- Deployment confusion and potential conflicts

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] **Analysis Phase**: Document exact differences between applications
- [ ] **Consolidation Strategy**: Determine which application to keep as primary
- [ ] **Migration Plan**: Merge unique features from secondary to primary app
- [ ] **Testing**: Ensure no functionality is lost during consolidation
- [ ] **Cleanup**: Remove duplicate code and update documentation
- [ ] **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of consolidated application

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Single FastAPI application with all functionality preserved
- [ ] No duplicate routes or middleware configurations
- [ ] Unified database connection management
- [ ] All existing tests pass with consolidated architecture
- [ ] Updated documentation reflecting single application structure

### **T039: SECURITY DEVELOPMENT BYPASS RISK** üü°
**Priority**: HIGH (Security vulnerability)  
**Risk**: MEDIUM (Accidental production deployment)  
**Dependencies**: None  

**Issue**: `scripts/dev/auth_dev_bypass.py` completely disables authentication and could be accidentally deployed to production.

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Move development bypass tools to clearly marked dev-only location
- [ ] Add production deployment checks to prevent bypass tool inclusion
- [ ] Create environment-based authentication controls
- [ ] Update deployment documentation with security checklist
