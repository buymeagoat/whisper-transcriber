**Risk**: HIGH | **Impact**: System integrity compromised | **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Issue**: Two complete FastAPI applications (`app/main.py` + `api/main.py`) with duplicate functionality
- **Impact**: Maintenance nightmare, deployment conflicts, developer confusion, race conditions
- **Evidence**: 925+ lines vs 391+ lines with overlapping routes, middleware, authentication, database init
- **Required**: Consolidate to single application, merge unique features, comprehensive testing
- **Acceptance**: Single FastAPI app, no duplicate routes, unified DB connection, all tests pass

#### **I002: Security Development Bypass Risk**
**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: Production security breach | **Effort**: 1 week

- **Issue**: API documentation scattered, some endpoints undocumented
- **Impact**: Slower development, integration difficulties
- **Required**: Consolidate API docs, ensure all endpoints documented
- **Acceptance**: Single source API documentation, all endpoints covered

#### **I007: Missing CI/CD Pipeline**
**Risk**: LOW | **Impact**: Manual deployment errors | **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Issue**: No automated testing/deployment pipeline
- **Impact**: Manual release process, higher error risk, slower releases
- **Required**: GitHub Actions for testing, building, deployment
- **Acceptance**: Automated pipeline, tests run on PR, deployment automation

### **‚ö™ LOW (Nice to Have)**

#### **I008: Limited Monitoring Dashboard**
**Risk**: LOW | **Impact**: Operational visibility | **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Issue**: Basic health checks, limited real-time system visibility
- **Impact**: Slower issue detection, limited operational insights
- **Required**: Enhanced monitoring dashboard, alerting system
- **Acceptance**: Real-time system metrics, proactive alerting
