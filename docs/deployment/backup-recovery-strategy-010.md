# Backup & Recovery Strategy - Issue #010

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 1 week  
**Status:** In Progress  

## 📊 Data Analysis Summary

Based on repository analysis, the critical data that requires backup:

### **Critical Data Inventory**
| Data Type | Location | Size | Criticality | Backup Frequency |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|------------------|
| **SQLite Database** | `app.db` | 20KB | **CRITICAL** | Every 15 minutes |
| **User Uploads** | `storage/uploads/` | 12KB | **CRITICAL** | Real-time |
| **Transcripts** | `storage/transcripts/` | 16KB | **CRITICAL** | Real-time |
| **Configuration** | `.env`, `config/` | <1KB | **HIGH** | Daily |
| **Application Logs** | `logs/` | 212KB | **MEDIUM** | Daily |
| **Whisper Models** | `models/` | 5.0GB | **LOW** | Weekly* |

> *Models are downloadable and can be re-acquired, but backing up saves download time

### **Database Schema** 
```sql
-- Critical tables requiring backup:
- users (authentication data)
- jobs (transcription jobs and status)  
- metadata (transcript metadata)
- config (application settings)
- user_settings (user preferences)
- performance_metrics (monitoring data)
- audit_logs (security events)
- query_performance_logs (performance data)
```

## 🏗️ Backup Architecture Design

### **Three-Tier Backup Strategy**

#### **Tier 1: Real-Time Protection (RPO: 0-1 minutes)**
- **Database:** SQLite WAL mode with continuous journaling
- **Files:** inotify-based file change monitoring with immediate backup
- **Target:** Local backup storage with high-speed access

#### **Tier 2: Scheduled Backups (RPO: 15 minutes - 24 hours)**  
- **Database:** Point-in-time recovery snapshots every 15 minutes
- **Files:** Incremental backups with deduplication and compression
- **Target:** Local and remote storage (S3-compatible)

#### **Tier 3: Disaster Recovery (RPO: 24 hours)**
- **Full System:** Complete system state backup
- **Geographic:** Off-site backup storage
- **Testing:** Monthly recovery validation

### **Backup Storage Layout**
```
/backups/
├── realtime/           # Tier 1: Real-time backups
│   ├── database/       
│   │   ├── wal/        # Continuous WAL backups
│   │   └── snapshots/  # 15-minute snapshots
│   └── files/          
│       ├── uploads/    # Real-time file backup
│       └── transcripts/
├── scheduled/          # Tier 2: Scheduled backups
│   ├── daily/
│   ├── weekly/
│   └── monthly/
└── disaster-recovery/ # Tier 3: Full system backups
    ├── system-state/
    └── offsite-sync/
```

### **Retention Policy**
| Backup Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Real-time snapshots** | 24 hours | Local SSD |
| **Hourly incremental** | 7 days | Local + Remote |
| **Daily full** | 30 days | Local + Remote |
| **Weekly full** | 12 weeks | Remote |
| **Monthly archive** | 12 months | Cold storage |
| **Yearly archive** | 7 years | Archive storage |

### **Compression & Encryption**
- **Compression:** ZSTD (fast compression, good ratio)
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with key rotation
- **Integrity:** SHA-256 checksums for all backups
- **Deduplication:** Content-based chunking for file efficiency

## 🔧 Implementation Components

### **1. Backup Service Architecture**
```python
# Core backup service components:
BackupOrchestrator     # Main coordination service
DatabaseBackupEngine   # SQLite-specific backup logic  
FileBackupEngine       # File system backup with monitoring
CompressionEngine      # ZSTD compression with integrity
EncryptionEngine       # AES-256-GCM encryption
StorageBackends        # Local, S3, etc. storage adapters
ScheduleManager        # Cron-like scheduling system
HealthMonitor          # Backup success/failure monitoring
RecoveryManager        # Disaster recovery orchestration
```

### **2. Backup Storage Backends**
- **Local Storage:** High-performance local backup target
- **S3-Compatible:** AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, etc.
- **SFTP/SSH:** Remote server backup option
- **Cloud Storage:** Google Drive, Dropbox (for smaller deployments)

### **3. Monitoring & Alerting**
- **Success/Failure Tracking:** Every backup operation logged
- **Performance Metrics:** Backup speed, compression ratios, storage usage
- **Health Checks:** Backup integrity validation, storage space monitoring
- **Alerting:** Email/webhook notifications for failures
- **Dashboard:** Web UI for backup status and management
