# Project Design Overview

This repository implements a self‑contained audio transcription service. A FastAPI backend wraps the OpenAI Whisper command line tool and exposes endpoints for uploading audio, tracking progress, and retrieving transcripts.

## Minimum Viable Product
The application is considered working once these basics are functional:
- Jobs can be submitted with `/jobs` and processed with the Whisper CLI.
- Job status can be queried and transcripts downloaded.
- Metadata is generated and stored alongside transcripts.
- Alembic migrations run automatically so the SQLite schema is up to date.
- Logs are written for each job and for overall system activity.

## Architecture
- **FastAPI entry point**: `api/main.py` bootstraps the web app. It mounts static directories, sets up CORS, and defines all API endpoints.
- **Database layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM models are defined in `api/models.py` (`jobs` and `metadata` tables). `api/orm_bootstrap.py` runs Alembic migrations and validates the schema on startup.
- **Job flow**:
  1. Audio is uploaded via `POST /jobs`. The server stores it under `uploads/` and creates a new `Job` record.
  2. `handle_whisper` spawns the Whisper CLI to generate a `.srt` file under `transcripts/{job_id}`. The job status moves from `queued` → `processing`.
  3. On success the transcript is enriched by `metadata_writer.py`, which creates a JSON metadata file and DB entry. Status becomes `completed`. Failures update the status accordingly and save logs under `logs/`.

## Important Directories
- `uploads/` – user-uploaded audio files.
- `transcripts/` – per‑job folders containing `.srt` results and metadata.
- `logs/` – rotating log files for jobs and the system.
- `models/` – where Whisper models are stored if downloaded.
- `frontend/` – React app bundled into `api/static/` for the UI.

Key environment files include `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, and the `Dockerfile` used to build a runnable image. The older `audit_environment.py` helper script is optional and may be removed.

## API Overview
- **Job management**: `POST /jobs` to upload, `GET /jobs` and `GET /jobs/{id}` to query, `DELETE /jobs/{id}` to remove, `POST /jobs/{id}/restart` to rerun, and `/jobs/{id}/download` to fetch the transcript. `GET /metadata/{id}` returns generated metadata.
- **Admin actions** under `/admin` allow listing and deleting files, downloading all artifacts, resetting the system, and retrieving basic stats.
- **Logging endpoints** expose job logs and the access log. Static files under `/uploads`, `/transcripts`, and `/static` are served directly.

## Migrations and Logging
- Database schema migrations are managed with Alembic in `api/migrations/`. The `env.py` file loads `Base.metadata` so new models are detected automatically. Migration scripts live in `api/migrations/versions/`.
- Logging utilities in `api/utils/logger.py` create rotating per-job logs and a system log. Log level and optional stdout logging are controlled by environment variables.

This document summarizes the repository layout and how the core FastAPI service orchestrates Whisper transcription jobs.

## Current Functionality

### Frontend
- React-based single page app built with Vite and bundled under `api/static/`.
- Upload page lets users choose audio files and Whisper model size, then starts jobs and links to a status view.
- Active, Completed and Failed pages display jobs filtered by status with actions to view logs or restart/remove.
- Transcript viewer shows the final text in a simple styled page.
- Admin page lists server files, CPU/memory stats and provides buttons to reset the system or download all data.

### Backend
- REST endpoints handle job submission, progress checks, downloads and admin operations.
- Whisper runs in a background thread writing transcripts to `transcripts/` and logs to `logs/`.
- Metadata is extracted from each transcript and persisted to SQLite.
- Jobs survive server restarts by being rehydrated on startup if processing was incomplete.
