# T025 Phase 5: File Upload Optimization Architecture

## Overview
Design for chunked file uploads with parallel processing, resumable uploads, and real-time progress tracking.

## Current Limitations
- **Memory bottleneck**: Entire file loaded into memory (100MB limit)
- **No progress visibility**: Users see no upload status
- **No fault tolerance**: Network issues require complete restart
- **Single-threaded**: No parallel chunk processing
- **Basic validation**: Limited file security checks

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Chunked Upload Service
```python
# api/services/chunked_upload_service.py
class ChunkedUploadService:
    - chunk_size: 1MB chunks for optimal memory usage
    - max_parallel_chunks: 4 concurrent uploads
    - upload_session_timeout: 24 hours
    - max_file_size: 1GB (10x increase)
    
    Methods:
    - initialize_upload() -> session_id
    - upload_chunk(session_id, chunk_number, data)
    - finalize_upload(session_id) -> assembled file
    - resume_upload(session_id) -> missing chunks
    - cancel_upload(session_id)
```

### 2. Upload Session Management
```python
class UploadSession:
    - session_id: UUID
    - user_id: String
    - original_filename: String
    - total_chunks: Integer
    - chunk_size: Integer
    - uploaded_chunks: Set[Integer]
    - file_hash: String (for integrity)
    - created_at: DateTime
    - expires_at: DateTime
    - status: enum[active, assembling, completed, failed]
```

### 3. Parallel Chunk Processing
```python
class ChunkProcessor:
    - AsyncWorkerPool for concurrent chunk handling
    - Thread-safe chunk validation
    - Memory-efficient streaming
    - Automatic retry logic for failed chunks
    - Chunk integrity verification (SHA256)
```

### 4. Real-time Progress Tracking
```python
class UploadProgressTracker:
    - WebSocket integration for live updates
    - Progress events: chunk_uploaded, validation_complete, assembly_started
    - Metrics: bytes_transferred, chunks_remaining, estimated_time
    - Error reporting: chunk failures, validation errors
```

### 5. Resume Capability
```python
class ResumeManager:
    - Persistent session storage in Redis
    - Missing chunk detection
    - Partial file reconstruction
    - Network interruption recovery
    - Client-side upload state restoration
```

## API Endpoints

### Upload Management
- `POST /uploads/initialize` - Start chunked upload session
- `POST /uploads/{session_id}/chunks/{chunk_number}` - Upload single chunk
- `POST /uploads/{session_id}/finalize` - Complete and assemble file
- `GET /uploads/{session_id}/status` - Get upload progress
- `DELETE /uploads/{session_id}` - Cancel upload
- `GET /uploads/{session_id}/resume` - Get missing chunks for resume

### Admin Monitoring
- `GET /admin/uploads/active` - List active upload sessions
- `GET /admin/uploads/metrics` - Upload performance statistics
- `POST /admin/uploads/{session_id}/cancel` - Admin cancel upload
- `GET /admin/uploads/storage` - Storage usage metrics

## Storage Strategy

### Temporary Chunk Storage
```
uploads/
  sessions/
    {session_id}/
      chunks/
        chunk_001.tmp
        chunk_002.tmp
        ...
      metadata.json
      progress.json
```

### File Assembly Process
1. Validate all chunks received
2. Verify chunk integrity (SHA256)
3. Stream chunks to final file location
4. Cleanup temporary chunk files
5. Create transcription job
6. Update progress via WebSocket

## Performance Targets

### Upload Improvements
- **File Size**: 100MB â†’ 1GB (10x increase)
- **Memory Usage**: 90% reduction via streaming
- **Upload Speed**: 50% improvement via parallel chunks
- **Resume Time**: <5 seconds for interrupted uploads
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time WebSocket notifications

### System Scalability
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support 100+ simultaneous uploads
- **Chunk Throughput**: 1000+ chunks/minute processing
- **Storage Efficiency**: 95% cleanup of temporary files
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for transient failures

## Security Enhancements

### Chunk Validation
- File type verification per chunk
- Magic number validation
- Virus scanning integration points
- Malicious file detection

### Session Security
- User-isolated upload sessions
- Session token validation
- Upload quota enforcement
- Rate limiting per user

## Integration Points

### WebSocket Integration
- Real-time progress updates
- Error notifications
- Completion alerts
- Resume status messages

### Job Processing
- Seamless handoff to transcription pipeline
- Metadata preservation
- Priority queue integration
- Resource optimization

### Frontend Components
- Chunked upload client
- Progress visualization
- Resume functionality
- Error handling UI

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 5A: Core Chunked Upload Service

## Success Criteria

1. **Performance**: Upload 1GB files in <2 minutes on good connection
2. **Reliability**: 99% upload success rate with resume capability
3. **User Experience**: Real-time progress with <1 second update latency
4. **Scalability**: Handle 50+ concurrent uploads without degradation
