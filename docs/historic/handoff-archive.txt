# Whisper Transcriber: Logging & Project State Handoff

## 🔍 Project Summary

Whisper Transcriber is a WSL2-based, local-first transcription system leveraging OpenAI's Whisper CLI. It is backed by FastAPI and designed for high observability, strict file controls, and full offline capability. This document details our current progress, false starts, design pivots, and pending issues with a special focus on restoring logging.

└── design_scope.md       # Master design document
```

### 🧠 Whisper CLI

* Installed globally and confirmed working
* Can load models from `--model_dir models/`
* CLI usage is stable with multiple model sizes

### 🔧 Backend

* FastAPI running via `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
* Uploads create UUID-based job IDs and route to Whisper
* All processing is tracked by job ID

### 🖼️ Frontend

* Bootstrapped using Vite + React + Tailwind
* Models listed via dropdown
* File input wired to POST `/jobs`
* Working visual response for job success/failure

---

## ❌ Logging: Current Problems

### ⚠️ Symptoms

* `logs/` remains empty
* `outputs/<job_id>.log` not being generated
* POST job failures show JSON error on frontend
* Backend shows no runtime error

### 📉 Regression Detected

Logging previously functioned. We suspect a patch or refactor (possibly during frontend/backend merge) bypassed or broke per-job logging routines.

---

## 🧾 Logging Requirements (from design\_scope.md)

* Log job start, file name, duration, model, and CLI args
* Store logs per-job in `outputs/`
* Preserve Whisper stdout/stderr
* Include fallback errors or crashes

---

## 🧪 Tests We've Done

### ✅ Successes

* Transcriptions worked when using CLI directly
* FastAPI file uploads are saved correctly in `uploads/`
* Model selection works in frontend

### ❌ Failures

* `logs/` directory is no longer written to
* `outputs/` only gets Whisper transcript, no `.log`
* Killing the backend would sometimes flush buffer to file (not ideal)
* Curl-based manual POSTs did not result in log creation

### 🧪 Diagnostic Attempts

* Checked `subprocess.Popen` output and redirection
* Verified job ID is passed and used consistently
* Added print statements and saw Whisper start correctly

---

## 🛠️ Hypotheses

1. **Subprocess buffering stdout/stderr:** Default buffering may hold logs in memory and never flush.
2. **Incorrect log path:** Code may not be targeting `outputs/` reliably.
3. **Logging disabled by `subprocess.run()` refactor:** This change may have accidentally bypassed log routing.
4. **FastAPI thread dies before completion:** Whisper may still be running in background while FastAPI returns prematurely.

---

## 🔁 Abandoned Paths & Notes

### ❌ Tailwind Install via NPM

* Tailwind NPM install silently failed multiple times
* Switched to manual binary download in `frontend/bin/tailwindcss`
* Removed from git history due to 100MB GitHub limit

### ❌ `--download_root` CLI argument

* Attempted to use `--download_root models/` for Whisper models
* CLI did not support this; replaced with `--model_dir models/`

### ❌ Early frontend scaffold

* Old setup lacked Tailwind, unclear routing
* Replaced with Vite + React
* Tailwind manually wired with CLI + `output.css`

---

## ✅ Next Immediate Task: Logging Fix

### 🔧 Task Plan

1. Wrap `subprocess.Popen()` with manual logging pipe:

   * Redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to open `.log` file
   * Set `bufsize=1`, `universal_newlines=True`
   * Read line-by-line and write
2. Confirm that logs go to `outputs/<job_id>.log`
3. Ensure logs survive even on crash or cancel
4. Add logging start/end markers

Once logging is restored, we can validate frontend → backend flow again.

---

## 🧭 Ready for Handoff

* This document + design\_scope.md gives full state snapshot
* Forensic rebase is possible by reading git commits
* System is stable except for missing logging
* Awaiting next patch before resuming UI polish or model handling

🧠 GPT GUIDANCE PATTERNS
Known problems:
Inconsistent file placement instruction: GPT defaulted to /src/pages/ instead of keeping all components in /src/. Going forward, instruct GPT:
🔒 “Always assume /src/ as default storage for components unless otherwise requested.”

Updated convention (for GPT prompts):
"All new components go in /frontend/src/ unless otherwise specified."

"When suggesting new files, always state the full path, e.g. /frontend/src/TranscriptViewPage.jsx."

🚧 STILL TODO
Feature	Status	Notes
Logging output to .log	❌ Broken	No per-job .log in outputs/
Live logs	❌	Not started
UI model selector (in /jobs form)	⚠️ Partial	No dropdown yet
Transcript download as .txt, .json	✅	Raw /transcript/:id works
Retry failed jobs	⚠️	Restart endpoint works, but needs clarity
Auth for Admin panel	❌	Not started
Docker Compose setup	❌	Not started

🗂️ KEY FILES (AS OF LAST STATE)
Path	Role
api/main.py	FastAPI backend entrypoint
jobs.db	Tracks uploads + status

⏭️ TO CONTINUE
✅ If continuing in a new session:
Paste this document and say:

“Pick up from Whisper Transcriber – Handoff Snapshot. Assume file structure above. Let’s continue from where we left off.”

Suggested next areas:
Restore logging (highest dev priority)

UI enhancements:

Sortable columns

Filter/search by filename or status

Job restart UX

Improve confirmation + status display

# Whisper Transcriber — Handoff.txt

## ✅ New Decisions & Alignments

* Project uses `api/` instead of `backend/` for all backend logic — updated in `design_scope.md`.
* Whisper models are stored in `/models/`, tracked via `.gitkeep`, not committed.
* Output transcripts are saved to `/transcripts/`, replacing `/outputs/`.
* `.gitignore` preserves folder structure using `.gitkeep` in `logs/`, `uploads/`, `transcripts/`, `metadata/`, and `models/`.
* `jobs.db` is committed and located in the project root.
* `logger.py` implemented with RotatingFileHandler (10MB x 3), per-job log path: `logs/{job_id}.log`.
* `audit_environment.py` script is the canonical tool for verifying project state.

## ⏭️ TODOs / Open Build Steps

* [ ] Extract page logic from `App.jsx` into dedicated files in `frontend/src/pages/`
* [ ] Create `frontend/public/index.html` to enable Vite builds
* [ ] Implement `api/metadata_writer.py` (generates abstract + keywords)
* [ ] Implement `api/models.py` (defines DB schema for `jobs.db`)
* [ ] Implement `orchestrate.py` for CLI-based job management
* [ ] Generate initial `tests/` directory with minimal coverage
* [ ] Optionally scaffold Alembic migrations under `api/migrations/`

## 📌 Standing Instructions

* Always request the latest `project_audit.txt` generated by `audit_environment.py` before verifying project state.
* Do not ask for zipped folders — rely on audit script output.
* Do not rename `api/` — it is a fixed replacement for `backend/`.
* Local filesystem is the source of truth; GitHub is a sync target only.

## 🧠 Context Loading for Next Session

1. Load `design_scope.md`
2. Load this `handoff.txt`
3. Parse `project_audit.txt` if provided
4. Proceed to the next build step in the TODOs above

🎬 Current Behaviour
• Upload audio → POST /jobs ⇒ returns job_id (202)
• Background Whisper runs, then metadata_writer; states:
   processing → enriching → completed | failed
• Download endpoints in place:
   /audio/{id}  /transcript/{id}
• Job controls in place:
   POST /jobs/{id}/restart  (same id, resets to processing)
   DELETE /jobs/{id}
• Alembic env wired but migration scripts still TODO.
• 100 % tests passing (pytest) on Python 3.10.

📝 Known Gaps / Next Tickets
1. **Frontend**  
   ▢ UploadPage.jsx needs multi-file UI, validation  
   ▢ DashboardPage.jsx (admin KPIs)  
   ▢ SettingsPage.jsx scaffold only
2. **CLI** orchestrate.py — param parsing & watch mode unfinished
3. **Alembic** — generate first migration & CI check
4. **Heartbeat** table + /heartbeat endpoint (stall detection)
5. **Log viewer UI** (nice-to-have)
6. **Auth layer** (token header stubs in design_scope)

⚠️ Design-scope is now single-source of truth; any new feature must update it first.

## Whisper Transcriber — Full Session Handoff Document

### 📌 Project Summary

This session focused on reconciling implementation drift across the Whisper Transcriber backend, aligning it tightly with `design_scope.md`. We examined, audited, repaired, and validated logic for ingestion, processing, metadata enrichment, and job tracking. Frontend tasks were explicitly deferred.

---

### ✅ Core Goals

1. Ensure output of the transcription process matches log-based transcript format.
2. Validate and correct all DB schema and file IO logic.
3. Create a single authoritative system diagram in canvas.
4. Confirm that `design_scope.md` is accurately implemented.

---

### 🔍 Audited Files (In Detail)

#### `main.py`

* Validated ingestion endpoint `/jobs` and all DB insertion logic.
* Confirmed thread-based `handle_whisper` function logs properly to `/logs/{job_id}.log`.
* Identified deviation in transcript file naming (no timestamped transcript output).
* Confirmed proper status updates after enrichment phase.

#### `metadata_writer.py`

* Confirmed metadata and transcript summaries are generated from `raw.txt`.
* Patched to also emit final `{original_filename}.txt` with proper content from `/logs/{job_id}.log`.

#### `init_db.py`

* Identified and corrected schema mismatch (`saved_filename` was missing).
* Rebuilt DB using corrected schema, validated tables:

  * `jobs`: `id`, `filename`, `saved_filename`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `error_message`, `transcript_path`
  * `metadata`: `job_id`, `lang`, `tokens`, `duration`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `vector_id`
  * `heartbeats`: `worker_id`, `last_beat`

#### `orchestrate.py`

* Parsed for batch CLI ingestion. Jobs were being submitted but failing due to backend DB mismatch.
* Correct behavior now expected after DB rebuild.

---

### 🛠️ Fixes Applied

* Patched `main.py` to wait for `metadata_writer` to succeed before marking job `completed`.
* Modified `metadata_writer.py` to emit full transcript output using log data.
* Cleaned up DB and validated all table schemas.

---

### 📁 Files Uploaded

* `design_scope.md`
* `main.py`, `metadata_writer.py`, `init_db.py`, `orchestrate.py`
* Several zip files and `.txt`/`.md` samples to confirm expected transcript output format.
* Logs and metadata confirmed structure and failure conditions.

---

### 🧭 System Workflow Status

* Canvas doc **"Workflow Diagram"** is now canonical, complete representation of `design_scope.md`.
* Any file audits must now compare against this canvas.

---

### 🧩 Outstanding Items

* Deep audit of `orchestrate.py` logic
* Confirm frontend file behaviors match scope:

  * `UploadPage.jsx`, `TranscriptViewPage.jsx`, `ActiveJobsPage.jsx`
* Embed restart/recovery behaviors for jobs that fail or stall
* Confirm heartbeat logic flags failures properly
* Create test plan using `test_audio/speech.wav`
* Hook up final transcript to download endpoint with correct format

---

### 📦 Session Summary for Handoff

* Drift has been identified and corrected between logic and schema
* Transcript output format now expected to match `/logs/{job_id}.log`
* DB schema validated and rebuilt
* Canvas updated to reflect true state of `design_scope.md`
* Frontend implementation deferred until backend confirmed stable

Project: Whisper Transcriber  
Date: 2025-06-04  
Developer: buymeagoat  
Session Lead: Whisper Transcriber GPT  

Summary:
- Whisper transcription pipeline using FastAPI backend, SQLite, and OpenAI Whisper CLI is now reliably functional.
- Database locking bugs patched using consistent thread-safe access and retry logic.
- Metadata writer now logs success/failure and uses retry/backoff strategy under lock.
- Logs stream correctly with line-buffering and flush on all I/O.
- Whisper subprocess output is captured and threaded.
- Final job status updates are committed reliably and logged.

Stable:
✓ Upload endpoint creates job and file
✓ Whisper runs in subprocess and exits with code 0
✓ Logs are flushed and visible via `tail -f`
✓ `metadata_writer` completes and creates `metadata.json`
✓ Database status transitions: queued → processing → enriching → completed

Known:
- Transcripts use `.srt`, not `.txt` — `run_metadata_writer` reads `job_id.srt`
- Still assumes English language (`--language en`) and default sample rate (16000 Hz)
- No UI/frontend yet; all interaction via CLI and API
- No health check endpoint
- No concurrency throttle (e.g. job queueing, rate limits)
- Metadata content (`tokens`, `abstract`) depends on availability and format of `.srt` file

Key Files Patched:
- `main.py`: consistent `db_lock` use, flush logs, subprocess lifecycle
- `metadata_writer.py`: retry loop, file path correctness, `db_lock` optionality

Next Steps (Suggested):
1. Test with longer audio to verify stability under load.
2. Add `/health` and `/version` endpoints.
3. Implement retry/resume on failed jobs (rehydration currently limited).
4. Improve status messaging (e.g. “queued”, “processing”, “transcribing”, “saving”).
5. UI or CLI wrapper for less technical users.

Artifacts:
- `main.py`, `metadata_writer.py` — latest synced and clean
- `transcripts/<job_id>/` — holds `srt`, `metadata.json`
- `logs/<job_id>.log` — line-buffered log of subprocess + metadata steps

Transfer:
✅ Safe to continue from current `main.py`, `metadata_writer.py`  
✅ Can test job creation via `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/jobs -F "file=@uploads/<audio>"`

End of handoff.

🚀 Instructions: Start Frontend Development
Step 1 – Use design_scope.md as Canonical
This file defines MVP endpoints, required user workflows, and expected frontend responsibilities.

Your job: Translate the user goals into interactive frontend behavior.

Anchor: “Transcription Job Lifecycle” and “User Needs” sections.

Step 2 – Start with Job Submission UI
Match /jobs POST endpoint

Allow:

File upload (drag-and-drop or selector)

Model selection (base, small, etc.)

Display returned job_id

Step 3 – Build Job Status Viewer
Poll /jobs/{job_id} GET endpoint

Show:

Status (e.g. processing, completed)

Link to transcript or download when ready

Step 4 – Provide Transcript Access
GET /transcripts/{job_id} to retrieve .srt

Optional: render inline with subtitles OR offer download

⚙️ Frontend Stack Considerations
Per project scope and best practices:

Framework: React (recommended for async status updates)

Styling: Tailwind (for minimal scaffolding)

API Integration: Use fetch() or Axios to POST/GET

No backend coupling beyond HTTP endpoints

🚨 PostCSS / Tailwind Plugin Error Loop
Current error:

rust
Copy
Edit
[postcss] It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin.
Root cause: Tailwind CSS v4 cannot be used with manual PostCSS config unless the correct plugin wrapper is configured.

✅ Known Good Configuration (Use This)
postcss.config.js
js
Copy
Edit
import tailwindcssPostcss from '@tailwindcss/postcss'
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'

export default {
  plugins: [
    tailwindcssPostcss(),  // this wrapper solves Tailwind v4 requirement
    autoprefixer()
  ]
};
📦 Confirm @tailwindcss/postcss is installed
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @tailwindcss/postcss --save-dev
📁 Location
Ensure this is inside:
~/dev/whisper-transcriber/frontend/

✅ Scripts and Build Commands
Start Dev Server: npm run dev from frontend/

Build for prod: npm run build

Clean reinstall (if broken):

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules dist package-lock.json .vite
npm install
🧠 Design Principle
You requested a single mental model:

Click "View" → browser window with timestamps + transcribed words
This is now working end-to-end.

⏭️ Suggested Next Steps
 Resolve Tailwind/PostCSS config loop using correct plugin.

 Test in production build (npm run build + static server).

 Style transcript viewer (/transcript/<id>/view) for readability.

Whisper Transcriber – Handoff Summary
Filename: handoff-current.txt
Generated: 2025-06-05
Session Purpose: Continue incremental development toward MVP of Whisper Transcriber.
Source of Truth: Always defer to design_scope.md.

✅ Current MVP Focus
We're implementing admin tooling to support:

File inspection (logs/, uploads/, transcripts/)

Manual deletion of individual files

Full system reset (clears DB and all file folders)

Zip download of all data

Display job progress (live log view)

Proper cleanup of failed/completed jobs (log deletion, etc.)

🧭 Current State by Component
adminpage.jsx
✅ Functional:

Loads logs/uploads/transcripts via /admin/files

Deletes individual files with confirmation

Triggers /admin/reset to wipe state

Triggers /admin/download_all to download ZIP

⚠️ Open Issues:

No user feedback mechanism besides alert()
→ We started work to support a feedback state to show success messages inline.

Feedback block not integrated yet
→ See pending insertion block below.

Filename key collision warning from React when using key={name}
→ Use key={${dir}-${name}} instead.

Consider toast/status bar instead of alert() for UX.

👉 NEXT SESSION: Ask for latest adminpage.jsx source before continuing patching.

main.py
✅ Functional:

Endpoints exist for:

/admin/files (list)

/admin/files (DELETE)

/admin/reset

/admin/download_all

Full job lifecycle supported: submit, restart, delete, view log, download transcript

⚠️ Open:

None blocking; error previously with ErrorCode.INVALID_REQUEST was never present, resolved.

Job Lifecycle / Logging
Active jobs display correctly.

Users can:

View live logs via /log/:jobId

View transcript via /transcript/:jobId/view

Completed job deletion now cleans log file.

Failed jobs can be restarted or deleted (handled in FailedJobsPage.jsx).

🛠 Files Expected Next Session
The next session must not assume internal state and instead request the following files:

adminpage.jsx → to continue UI patches (feedback block + better list keying)

design_scope.md → verify MVP trajectory and requirements

project_audit.txt → tree view of project structure (especially if new pages/components are introduced)

🧩 Last Attempted Patch (Incomplete)
We began integrating this block to display success messages:

jsx
Copy
Edit
{feedback && (
  <p style={{ color: "#22c55e", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>{feedback}</p>
)}
✅ This block should be inserted just after the {error && ...} block in the return statement.

🚫 But feedback is not yet defined in useState, and handlers like handleReset or handleDelete must be updated to use setFeedback("...") instead of alert(...).

⏭️ Immediate Next Steps
Request and patch adminpage.jsx to:

 Add const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(null);

 Replace alert() calls with setFeedback(...)

 Add visual feedback block (see above)

 Improve key={name} to key={${dir}-${name}} in list mapping

Optionally:

 Replace alert() with a non-blocking toast/status banner (if scoped in design_scope.md)

✅ File Verification & Pre-Containerization Checklist
📂 Code File Validation
Task	Responsibility	Notes
🔲 Validate api/main.py routes against frontend usage	ChatGPT	Confirm each route has a corresponding frontend consumer
🔲 Check StaticFiles mount consistency (/uploads, /transcripts, /logs)	ChatGPT	Confirm these are accessible directly and via Admin page
🔲 Ensure all job IDs return valid .srt or .txt downloads from /jobs/{job_id}/download	User	Manually trigger test jobs
🔲 Crosscheck all uses of upload_path, log_path, job_dir, etc.	ChatGPT	Confirm consistent across main.py and metadata_writer.py
🔲 Ensure all template paths use Path(...).resolve() or are relative to ROOT	ChatGPT	Avoid broken paths in Docker
🔲 Verify no hardcoded “localhost” outside of VITE_API_HOST logic	ChatGPT	Check AdminPage.jsx and App.jsx

🧪 Test Run Prep (Pre-Container)
Task	Responsibility	Notes
🔲 Submit job and allow to complete	User	Check transcript appears in /transcripts and Admin
🔲 Submit job with missing ffprobe	User	Ensure error is raised correctly
🔲 Delete job and verify logs + uploads are removed	User	Try manual + Admin panel deletion
🔲 Restart job and ensure regeneration works	User	Try from Admin panel

🐳 Containerization Prep
Task	Responsibility	Notes
🔲 Replace print() calls with structured logging if container logs are critical	ChatGPT	Suggest standard format if needed
🔲 Define volume mounts for: uploads, logs, transcripts	User	For persistent data
🔲 Add .env validation for DB, VITE_API_HOST	ChatGPT	Add fallback or warnings if unset
🔲 Ensure FastAPI’s lifespan() does not trigger transient job resurrections without logs	ChatGPT	Evaluate rehydrate_incomplete_jobs() safety

📎 Carry-Forward Design Principles
The next session must adhere to the following execution template:

Prompt Template (copyable)

vbnet
Copy
Edit
I am working on the Whisper Transcriber project.

You are to diagnose or fix issues without relying on cached memory or prior context. Treat this as your first time seeing each issue unless you've reverified that previous fixes or assumptions still apply in the latest code I share. You must treat the current file contents as the only canonical state unless explicitly told otherwise.

👇 Execution Protocol:
1. First Principles Only
2. File-Backed Line Traceability
3. Full Explanation for Each Fix
4. Patch Chain Acknowledgment
5. Cleanup Rules
6. Debug Instrumentation (only if interpreted)

🧠 My Expectations:
→ Logical precision
→ File-backed traceability
→ Justified decisions
→ Honest state reconciliation when previous advice no longer applies
🧠 Known Future Feature Notes (Post-MVP)
Add .txt download alongside .srt → must retain timestamps

Consider support for viewing failed/completed jobs in the browser as playable media or readable text (audio/text toggle)

Currently, updated_at in DB is unused but schema is preserved for future sorting or pagination

===============================
📦 WHISPER TRANSCRIBER – HANDOFF DOCUMENT
Session Date: 2025-06-06
Lead: Tony (buymeagoat@Snail)
Environment: WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04), Docker, GitHub (buymeagoat/whisper-transcriber)

✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
🔄 GitHub Reconciliation
Purged outdated master branch on GitHub and force-pushed current local main branch.

Verified .gitignore excludes all non-essential, bulky, or environment-bound files (e.g., node_modules, virtualenvs, logs, SQLite DB).

Preserved all project-critical IP, deployment logic, and reproducible scaffolding in GitHub.

.dockerignore was reviewed and patched — models/ was re-added due to being required at runtime.

🔁 Environment Reset
Fully uninstalled Docker components from both WSL and Windows (deleted all Docker-related directories).

Rebooted and verified Docker Desktop is running, WSL integrated, and Docker functions cleanly in Ubuntu-22.04.

📦 Project Files & Database Handling
✅ Database Bootstrapping
Created a validate_or_initialize_database() function in main.py:

Auto-generates jobs.db if missing using SQLAlchemy metadata.

Validates schema structure for both jobs and metadata tables.

Logs issues via backend_log and halts on mismatch with sys.exit(1).

✅ Logging Integration
All print() and error outputs were verified or refactored to route through logging (FastAPI + custom get_logger).

✅ .env Handling
Application uses dotenv to load required env vars (VITE_API_HOST) early during main.py execution.

Fails cleanly if variables are missing.

🔧 IN PROGRESS
🐳 Dockerization Process
Current Status:
Docker Desktop is installed and functional.

.dockerignore and Dockerfile have been uploaded and partially audited.

Determined that:

models/ must be included due to Whisper CLI dependency.

jobs.db must be generated at runtime and is now handled safely in main.py.

.env files are safe to exclude from source control, but must exist at runtime (we'll generate default in image or require mount).

Remaining Tasks:
✅ [DONE] Verify model files must be bundled in container (models/).

🔜 Finalize Dockerfile to:

Copy only what’s needed (obey .dockerignore)

Install requirements cleanly

Set working directory properly

Execute main.py or launch FastAPI via uvicorn

🔜 Build and test image locally (docker build / run)

🔜 Ensure exposed port matches frontend config (VITE_API_HOST)

🔜 Create a docker-compose.yml file (optional, for local dev)

🔜 Validate that /api/jobs, /logs, and model directories are writable inside container

🔜 Run healthcheck or test route in container to verify API launches

⚠️ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Whisper CLI binary must be available in the Docker image (whisper in PATH).

ffprobe is required for get_duration() — ensure it's installed in container (via ffmpeg).

SQLite file lock behavior under Docker/WAL mode should be revalidated in volume-mount scenarios.

⏭️ NEXT STEP
👉 Finalize and validate the Dockerfile contents.
You can now safely proceed to refining the image build steps.
