Task: Update operating blueprint to reflect revised CAG instruction densification behavior.
Objective: Codify that rationale lines are not required in the densified CAG instructions and require bundle headers at file top; update generation pipeline for Architect-led densification.
Constraints: Preserve existing behavior and rule structure; do not alter roles, gates, or functional logic.
