## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Category 1: Import Errors (14 failures) - ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Missing `get_db` function import in main.py  
**Solution**: Added proper import from `api.orm_bootstrap`  
**Impact**: Fixed all FastAPI database dependency injection errors

### Category 2: Database Table Missing (7 failures) - ✅ RESOLVED  
**Problem**: Missing `security_audit_logs` table required by security middleware  
**Solution**: Successfully created table with proper schema and indexes  
**Impact**: Security audit logging now functional

### Category 3: User Model Mismatches (8 failures) - ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Tests assumed incorrect User model fields (email field, wrong structure)  
**Solution**: Updated tests to match actual User model (username, hashed_password, role)  
**Impact**: All database tests now align with production model

### Category 4: SQLAlchemy API Updates (2 failures) - ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Deprecated SQLAlchemy methods and missing text() requirements  
**Solution**: Updated to current SQLAlchemy 2.0+ API patterns  
**Impact**: Tests compatible with modern SQLAlchemy version

### Category 5: Authentication Endpoint Path Issues (1 failure) - ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Tests using wrong endpoint paths  
**Solution**: Updated to use correct /api/auth/* paths matching frontend  
**Impact**: Tests now validate actual authentication endpoints
