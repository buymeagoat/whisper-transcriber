# Load Test Attempt – 2025-11-08

- **Status:** Blocked – k6 binary not available in remediation container
- **Command:** `python perf/run_load_test.py --no-archive`
- **Notes:** The updated load scenario now targets `/uploads → /jobs`, but the environment lacks the `k6` executable, so no metrics were produced. Install k6 before rerunning.
