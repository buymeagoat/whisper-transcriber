# To enable passwordless sudo for the build script, add the following line to your sudoers file:

buymeagoat ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash /home/buymeagoat/dev/whisper-transcriber/scripts/whisper_build.sh

# Steps:
# 1. Run: sudo visudo
# 2. Add the above line at the end of the file.
# 3. Save and exit.
# This allows the user 'buymeagoat' to run the build script with sudo without being prompted for a password.
# For security, this only applies to the specific script, not all sudo commands.
